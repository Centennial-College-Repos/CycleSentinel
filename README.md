# CycleSentinel

This project aims to develop a predictive software solution for both law enforcement agencies and the general public to assess the likelihood of bicycle theft incidents. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning four years, collected by the Toronto Police Department, the software provides valuable insights into anti-theft measures and precautions for specific neighborhoods.
